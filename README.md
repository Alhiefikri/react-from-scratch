# React from Scratch

This repository contains my learning journey as I build projects and experiment with **React** from the ground up. Each folder represents a different concept or project as I explore the fundamentals and advanced features of React.

## ðŸ“š Whatâ€™s Inside
- **Basic React Concepts**: Components, JSX, Props, State, Lifecycle
- **React Router**: Navigation and routing between pages
- **Hooks**: useState, useEffect, and custom hooks
- **API Integration**: Fetching data from external APIs
- **Project-based Learning**: Small apps and components as learning exercises

## ðŸš€ Goals
- Build dynamic and interactive UIs
- Gain mastery over React ecosystem and best practices
- Prepare for full-stack development using React

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure
- `/basic-concepts`: React fundamentals
- `/projects`: Small projects showcasing React features
- `/hooks`: Learning and applying hooks

## âš¡ Get Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install`

Stay tuned for more updates as I progress through the journey!
